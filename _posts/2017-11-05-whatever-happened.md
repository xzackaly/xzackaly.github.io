title: "Whatever Happened To Learning On The Job??"
description: Why has learning on the job fallen out of favor in the I/T world? Is it our romance with the "garage geek superstar" model?

I miss Active Learning.<br><br>I am a software programmer from the legacy mainframe realm where “active learning” was de rigueur:<br>

    <h4 style="text-align:center">Technologies I Learned <big>AFTER</big> Getting The Job</h4>

<br>I learned all those (then) state of the art technologies <em><strong> on the job, AFTER BEING HIRED</strong></em>. The I/T director I worked for in JOB3 headhunted me for JOB6 to fill his AS400 programmer slot even though I told him the only thing I knew about "AS400" was how to spell it! He knew it was just a matter of getting the opportunity to be exposed to it, I could handle it..and he was right. I achieved two personal bests at that job.<br><br>Acquiring expertise in I/T software requires an immersive environment.  You need the <b>OPPORTUNITY</b> to “learn while doing”, the personal <b>ABILITY</b> to “learn while doing”, and the <strong>ARTISTRY</strong> to produce desired results.<br><br>

Web tech instructors implore students to “go home and build something”.  The best way to learn a technology is to use it, I agree. But, the biggest hurdle I’ve found in building a web offering at home is:<br>
 <p align="center" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#555555; padding: 20px;background-color:#f9f9f9;font-weight: 900;">Finding out how the multiple pieces of software collaborate.</p><br>
 I/T training outside of a job environment generally falls into two categories:
<ol>
<li><strong><big>Too segmented.</big></strong> When the front-end BigThree  (that is HTML/CSS/JavaScript) is new to the learner, they need to be taught together.</li>
<li><strong><big>Too esoteric.</big></strong> Am I the only one who’s had to Stack Overflow the Stack Overflow answer?</li></ol><br>Back when COBOL was king, I had a friend who took a six-month COBOL course and got a job.  She told me at her first gig, she had no idea about &quot;parmlibs, procs, VSAM&quot;. But she learned as she went along. I, too, am learning web tech as I go along.  My legacy I/T knowledge constantly informs me. IMS hierarchy certainly applies to the DOM.  Positional and keyword parameter driven “functions” abound in legacy software.  CICS makes heavy use of “on” events. High-level-qualifiers relate to dot notation.

However, internet training courses offer an abundance of non-contextual learning.  When you learn out of context, it’s like attending a cooking class on how to boil an egg and then being told to go home and make a <span class="ttstyle">
    <span  class="tooltip" data-tip="kuh NELL. Food served in egg-shaped portions">quenelle ( a what??)
        </span></span>.<br><br> 
We need context. We need Active Learning.<br><br>
 <a class="local01" href="https://www.nickelled.com/blog/why-are-people-who-went-to-montessori-schools-so-absurdly-successful/" target="_blank"><font color="blue"> Maria Montessori</font></a> (yes, _that_ one) and 
<a class="local01" href="https://www.pbs.org/onlyateacher/john.html" target="_blank"><font color="blue"> John Dewey</font></a> were active learning adherents who believed that:<br>
 <blockquote style="font-family: Helvitica, sans-serif"> Active Learning emphasizes the fact that learning should be relevant, situated within a meaningful context, and connected to the real world. (extracted from <a class="local01" href="http://www.cambridgeinternational.org/images/271174-active-learning.pdf" target="_blank"><font color="blue">  Cambridge International Education</font></a> materials)</blockquote><br>
Is there no place for the experienced active learner in today’s I/T?<br><br>
Speaking of experienced, a former colleague from the legacy world&mdash;and one of the best programmers with whom I have ever worked&mdash;has written a JAVA programming book: &quot;<strong><em>Do You Speak Java?</em> Java Language Fundamentals</strong>&quot;, by <strong>Aleks Rudenko</strong>.  I saw his name and bought his book immediately.  For me, the first 8 pages clearly explain <span class="ttstyle">
    <span  class="tooltip" data-tip="Object Oriented Programming">OOP
        </span></span>, polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance.  Thank you, Aleks.<br><br>
 
 Employers, consider looking for new hires with strong active learning skills. How to determine if a person is an Active Learner?  Ask the potential hire to describe a time when an OLD knowledge helped him acquire a NEW knowledge and solve a NEW problem.<br>
