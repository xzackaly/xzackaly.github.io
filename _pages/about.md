 <big>Welcome! XZackaly here.  I am a legacy software coder who is now teaching myself web programming, on the cheap. I use low/no cost methods of learning: meetups, video courses, community center classes, used books, and LOTS of Google and YouTube.  I have waded through beaucoup material, and it seemed to be taking extraordinarily long for my brain to assimilate the information…after all, I’m not a total newbie. I know things…I’m smart! But I felt like Fredo:<br><br/></big>

<big>I was horrified to think it could be true that you can be too old to learn new things.  Then by happenstance, I overheard a 24 year-old classmate lament that she thought people who teach web stuff are intentionally trying to confuse things.

So, to build my web muscles, I’m blogging my adventures in learning....my Aha! moments and my frustrations. Fellow beginners, I hope you find both solace and good tips here.</big>
