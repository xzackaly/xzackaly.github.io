## Never Stop Learning

Honestly...I stumbled upon Jekyll.  The Saturday SQL meetup I was wavering about had filled up... so I clicked on the bio for the teacher...which led me to her blog and this post: http://veekaybee.github.io/2015/05/30/static-sites-suck/

I thought "Wow! I can create a blog within Git.  What a brilliant way to create a reason to learn and use Git!" 

So I did it. You are looking at the repo of my blog right now.

Details of the install follow, if you are interested......
## Details of Getting Jekyll Up and Running
I have a 2011 Windows laptop. Mostly used to pay bills and shop and store recipes. 

I started here:
https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/

and chose to follow these instructions: 

`If you are using Windows 10 version 1607 or later, another option to run Jekyll is by installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux.`

I chose the Ubuntu install, simply because I'd heard of it several years prior.  The Ubuntu installation went smoothly. 

I returned to the jekyllrb page to follow the remaining bash/Ruby/jekyll install steps.  Again..everything went smoothly. 

Yay!
